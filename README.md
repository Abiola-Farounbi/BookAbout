# BookAbout


BookAbout is a web application that allows users to sign up for an account, join book clubs, search for other users, and communicate about everything book-related. Our goal is to give book lovers a platform to build friendships with others like many book-related websites do not. 

BookAbout has many features that foster a discussion-based community for readers. Users can create profiles, find other profiles based on similar interests, join book clubs, and, most importantly, chat with each other. After all, BookAbout is all about the community.
